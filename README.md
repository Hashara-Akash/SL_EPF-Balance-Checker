# SL_EPF-Balance-Checker
In Sri Lanka there is a website for check the employee  balance but not an app where you can just check your epf balance  whenever you want like checking your bank balance with a smart  passbook app. What we have done here is very similar to a bank  smart passbook application, but the purpose is to check the epf  balance of government employees.
In the end of this development, the government 
employees can check their balance of epf simply using an android 
application which requires only simple registration where they will not
need to go to any office to waste their time.
As we know employees will never know until the end what is their balance, or if there is a doubt 
with balance when they check it with the bank or a certain department, 
they will never know what happened in the meantime. This app will 
prevent this from happening as the user can always check their 
balance.
